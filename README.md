Basic analysis on a Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/open-flights/flight-route-database using Java

Given the dataset, it returns MAX, DEPARTURES, LIMIT based on what the user inputs in the terminal

MAX: airport with the maximum number of total flights
DEPARTURES: Alphabetically sorted list of all destinations an airport flies to
LIMIT: cutoff for the total number of flights for each airport. Eliminates airports that don't have the limit count of flights.
